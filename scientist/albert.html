<p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born American scientist.[5] He worked on theoretical physics.[6] He developed the theory of relativity.[4][7] He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for theoretical physics.

    His famous equation is {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}E=mc^{2} (E = energy, m = mass, c = speed of light (energy = mass × speed of light²).
    
    At the start of his career, Einstein didn't think that Newtonian mechanics was enough to bring together the laws of classical mechanics and the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902–1909 he made the theory of special relativity to fix it</p>
